# My Portfolio
## L.O.O.P.S
Made this game in 3 days for the GMTK jam 2025. It is a arcadey/mobile type game where you protect a planet from threats.
Every asset made from scratch (I reused some old ones I made) besides font

## Just Another Heist
A stealth heist (secretly horror) game where you sneak through a well guarded mansion to obtain a strange item. The item gives you the ability to enter an alternate world where a monster chases you.
This game ended up being much more complicated than I thought. A ton of mechanics I took for granted in other games ended up being way more complex with how much they intertwined such as the item/inventory system, enemy AI, stealth, save system, etc. Like seriously I didn't realize the save system needed to "memorize" every enemy location and state, every item location and state, and player status and inventory. Most of the time making this game was programming and designing the mechanics, so I ended up not making as many assets of my own this time and finding most of them online for free.

## Gravity
My first UE5 Game where you play a first-person puzzle platformer; Kind of barebones as I mostly used the time to learn the basics of Unreal as I tried to make a 3D version of The Anti-Gravity. But a start nonetheless.

## The Anti-Gravity
A 2D puzzle platformer with every asset made from scratch. The physics/game mechanics were surprisingly easy to implement, so most of the time making this game was really the level design which I am especially proud of for this game. It is sort of metroidvania-like because it shows you sections that seem impossible at first but really you are just missing the powerup. My main focus for the level design here is to make difficult parts for the player to traverse, and after successfully passing the section and getting the powerup, the once difficult part becomes trivial with the new found ability.

## Project 00
My first game and what an experience it was. This game was the ultimate learning experiece as I learned more and more about game development, the game itself evolved and I made this a core part of the game. It is a 2D shoot-em-up where you pilot a spaceship and shoot down your enemies. There are three levels that each have different artstyles and mechanics that reflect the progress I was at in terms of being a game developer.
